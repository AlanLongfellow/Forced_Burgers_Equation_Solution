# Solution to the Forced Viscous Burgers Equation

- A research codebase and document set for a general solution of the forced viscous Burgers equation with arbitrary variable forcing developed by Alan C. Longfellow.
- Developed as a corollary to a similarly general solution to the Schrödinger equation (link: https://github.com/AlanLongfellow/Schrodinger_Solution)
- This repository aims to link formal paper(s) to all relevant proofs, supporting derivations, reproducible notebooks, reference implementations, and figure generation scripts to support community and peer reviewers.

## Claim (this v1.0 is deprecated as of 09/06/2025 due to Schrödinger revisions. Update to v1.1 pending formula validation):

For the forced Burgers equation:

$$
\frac{\partial u(x,t)}{\partial t} + a u(x,t) \frac{\partial u(x,t)}{\partial x} = f(x,t) + b \frac{\partial^2 u(x,t)}{\partial x^2}
$$

with velocity $u \left( \textbf{r}, t \right)$, force/pressure term $f \left(x, t \right)$, one-dimensional domain from $x = 0$ to $x = L$, admissible initial/boundary data, nonlinear damping $a$, and viscosity $b$, the method herein provides an explicit and closed-form construction of $u \left( x, t \right)$:

## Engineering Value Proposition:

- Most solutions in the literature cover particular forms of $f(x,t)$ such as $f(x,t) = g(x)h(t)$, $f(x,t) = g(x) + h(t)$, and the like. 
- This solution transcends the present limitation to special cases of $f(x,t)$ by satisfying the forced viscous Burgers equation for any $f(x,t)$.
- Compressible, nonlinear fluid dynamics problems requiring only one dimension may now undergo closed-form study.
- Slow numerical methods are sped up via analytical clarity, saving time and money in engineering workflows.
- Now some of your CFD codes don't need a solver anymore!
